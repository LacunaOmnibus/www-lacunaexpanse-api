SETUP
=====

First you need to create your own configuration by copying from the
template configuration files and making appropriate changes.

$ cd ~/lacuna/
$ cp myaccount.yml.template myaccount.yml
$ vi myaccount.yml

Follow the instructions in the myaccount.yml file setting up details
of your account etc.

You may also want to copy and edit the excavate.yml.template and
genetics.yml.template files as well at this point.

$ cp excavate.yml.template excavate.yml
$ vi excavate.yml

$ cp genetics.yml.template excavate.yml
$ vi excavate.yml

You will need to create an sqlite database and populate it with the data
from the stars.csv file provided by Lacuna Expanse and included in this
package. To do this follow these steps.

$ cd ~/lacuna/
$ cat db/lacuna.sql | sqlite3 db/lacuna.db

You can if you wish check that the schema has been set up by manually
running sqlite

$ sqlite3 db/lacuna.db
sqlite> .schema
sqlite> .exit

Now you will need to update the 'star' schema from the supplied csv file.

$ cd ~/lacuna/
$ perl scripts/import_csv.pl

You should now have a complete database of the us1 server
